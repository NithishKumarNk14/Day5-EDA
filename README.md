# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Task 5 - Data Analyst Internship

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, trends, and anomalies using Python.

---

## Objective

To gain insights into passenger survival rates by analyzing features such as age, sex, class, and fare. This analysis was done using statistical summaries and visualizations.

---

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab (or Jupyter Notebook)


---

## EDA Highlights

- Visualized distributions for age, fare, survival.
- Analyzed survival by gender, class, and fare.
- Created correlation heatmaps and pairplots.
- Summarized key insights and answered interview-style questions.

---

## Key Insights

- Majority of survivors were female.
- First-class passengers had a higher chance of survival.
- Fare and survival are positively correlated.
- Outliers observed in age and fare distributions.
